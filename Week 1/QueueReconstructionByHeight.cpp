// QUEUE RECONSTRUCTION BY HEIGHT

/*  PROBLEM:
    Suppose you have a random list of people standing in a queue. Each person is described 
    by a pair of integers (h, k), where h is the height of the person and k is the number of 
    people in front of this person who have a height greater than or equal to h. Write an 
    algorithm to reconstruct the queue.

    Note:
    The number of people is less than 1,100.
*/ 

/*  EXAMPLE:

    Input:
    [[7,0], [4,4], [7,1], [5,0], [6,1], [5,2]]

    Output:
    [[5,0], [7,0], [5,2], [6,1], [4,4], [7,1]]
*/

/*  APPROACH: Insertion Sort - O(n^2)
    1. Initialize an empty vector to insert each person.
    2. Compare each person such that
        a. If they do not have the same height (h) value, they should be sorted in ascending order.
        b. If they have the same height (h) value, sort them in descending order of the number of people in front of them (k).
    3. Insert each person into position k.
