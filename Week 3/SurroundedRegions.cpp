// SURROUNDED REGIONS

/*  PROBLEM:
    Given a 2D board containing 'X' and 'O' (the letter O), capture all regions surrounded by 'X'.
    A region is captured by flipping all 'O's into 'X's in that surrounded region.

    Surrounded regions shouldnâ€™t be on the border, which means that any 'O' on the border of the 
    board are not flipped to 'X'. Any 'O' that is not on the border and it is not connected to an 
    'O' on the border will be flipped to 'X'. Two cells are connected if they are adjacent cells 
    connected horizontally or vertically.
*/

/*  EXAMPLE:

    Input:
    X X X X
    X O O X
    X X O X
    X O X X

    Output:
    X X X X
    X X X X
    X X X X
    X O X X      
*/

/*  APPROACH: Depth-First-Search
    1. Iterate over the row and column boundaries of the board until an 'O' is encountered.
    2. Perform depth-first-search using the DFS helper function every time an 'O' is encountered, from its position.
    3. Convert all of the encountered 'O's during the DFS operation to '#' in order to mark the cells that cannot be converted to 'X'.
    4. When the DFS has been completed, there are three elements remaining on the board:
        a. 'X' - Do not make any changes.
        b. 'O' - Convert to 'X', since they are not connected to any boundary and therefore can be converted to 'X'.
        c. '#' - Convert back to 'O' since they are connected to some boundary and therefore cannot be converted to 'X'.
