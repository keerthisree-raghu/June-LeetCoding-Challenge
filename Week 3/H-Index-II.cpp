// H-INDEX II

/*  PROBLEM:
    Given an array of citations sorted in ascending order (each citation is a non-negative 
    integer) of a researcher, write a function to compute the researcher's h-index.

    Note:
    If there are several possible values for h, the maximum one is taken as the h-index.
*/

/*  EXAMPLE:

    Input: citations = [0,1,3,5,6]
    Output: 3 
    Explanation: 
    [0,1,3,5,6] means the researcher has 5 papers in total and each of them had 
    received 0, 1, 3, 5, 6 citations respectively. 
    Since the researcher has 3 papers with at least 3 citations each and the remaining 
    two with no more than 3 citations each, her h-index is 3.  
*/

/*  APPROACH: Binary Search - O(logn)
    1. Initialize the high and low pointers to point to the extreme ends of the sorted array.
    2. Calculate the mid-value.
    3. Check if the condition to find the h-index is satisfied by the mid element:
       citations[index] >= length(citations) - index
    4. Store the value of the remaining elements in a variable and continue the process to find the optimum value.
    5. When the first optimal value that satisfies the condition is found, return the value.
